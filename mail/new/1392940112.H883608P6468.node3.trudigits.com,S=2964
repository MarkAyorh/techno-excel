Attend Online and Learn 
-------------
SOA Summit is a multi-vendor online lead-gen event where industry experts will show how SOA and APIs are transforming the way F1000s think about IT and business models. Attendees will learn how to optimize their infrastructure, apps and data for the 'Extended Enterprise' and support cloud, SaaS, mobile and API-driven business.

Topics will include:

* SOA's Next Big ROI: The 'Extended Enterprise' 
As IT races to support cloud, SaaS and mobile, SOA is unlocking huge business value. 

* The New Power of API Management 
Allows firms to securely extend data and business services to devs and partners for new revenues. 

* SOA for Real-Time Business 
With high-performance, in-memory and easy integrations, SOA is delivering real-time speed and smarts to BPM, operations and BI / analytics. How cloud architectures and deployments are affected by on-premise SOA.

* SOA Security Made Simple
Safely and reliably secure sensitive enterprise data, apps, services wherever they are - on-premise, cloud or mobile.

* SOA and the 'Internet of Things' 
Internet devices will generate more data than humans with PCs or smartphones. SOA delivers and manages these massive new resources.
