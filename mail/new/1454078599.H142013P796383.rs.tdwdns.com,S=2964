Hi Mark, I was just following up on my earlier email below. Might now 
be better timing for you to join the group?

Subject: Mark, question.

Hi Mark, quick question for you because of your past experience and 
background.

I wanted to ask if you might like to become a part of our group. I 
think you would really enjoy the high level sharing of ideas and best 
practices.

For our next monthly teleconference meeting Deloitte's Vice Chairman 
of technology will lead a presentation and discussion on ways they 
have harnessed the Internet of Things to increase IT productivity. 
The following month Tribune's VP will lead a presentation and 
discussion on what is working to increase IT department and staff 
productivity.

Because of the value you would bring to the discussion, you can also 
subtract $150 from the regular dues (just put my name as the person 
who okayed this in the Comments field of the sign up page).

Our site is cioleaders.org and many of our member's names appear 
there. It is an exceptional group -- hopefully you can be part of it 
and you will enjoy meeting the others. Thanks Mark.


Kind regards,
Jason Williams
